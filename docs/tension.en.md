# Tensions

## Definition

Twitter use tweets, Gmail use e-mails, Fractale use tensions. A tension is a general communication object that is akin to an email and can be sent to any circle in Fractale. They are particularly suit to share, track and keep record of tasks, issues, ideas or questions.
Philosophically, a tension is defined as the distance between where you are and where you want to be.
A tension belong to a certain type according to the problem to deal with. There are four different types:

* **<g>Operational</g>**: a general category of tension which can be a task, an issue or whatever that need to be share in an organization.
* **<b>Governance</b>**: concerning the structure and the governance of the organization, i.e the circle, roles and mandates.
* **<o>Help</o>**: for help requests, questions or clarifications.
* **<r>Alert</r>**: for alerts, this are used for global announcement. All the member behind the circle alerted will be notified (Coordinator level required).

Furthermore, tensions can be closed when they are solved, or reopen if needed. Closed tensions are not visible in default view, yet they can be searched and displayed.

User-defined labels can be attached to it which gives visual hints and filtering capabilities. 

Users can be assigned to tensions if they are in charge of them.

## Notifications

When a tension is created, notification will be send to all the roles (their lead link) in the targeted circle of the organization.
Each tension is a discussion tread and have a list of susbscrided users. Users can subscribe or unsubscribe to a tension if they have read access to it. A subscribed users will be notify of new comments or state changes. At tension creation only its author is subscribed by default.

**Alert** tension behave differently by notifying all members of an organization, including [Guest role](/circle/#guest).
