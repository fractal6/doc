## Circles

A ***"Circle"*** is a container for organizing Roles, Policies and sub-Circles around a common purpose.

The visibility of a circle determine who have access to its content, i.e the tensions that target it.

* a **Public** circle means that the circle content is publicly accessible. 
* a **Private** circle means that only members of an organisation has access to it.
* a **Secret** circle means only roles inside that circle has access to it.

## Roles

From the [Holacracy](https://github.com/holacracyone) definition, a  ***"Role"*** is an organizational construct that a person can fill and then energize on behalf of the Organization. Whoever fills a Role is a ***"Role Lead"*** for that Role.

A Role definition consists of a descriptive name and one or more of the following:

1. a ***"Purpose"***, which is a capacity, potential, or goal that the Role will pursue or express.
2. one or more ***"Domains"***, which are assets, processes, or other things the Role may exclusively control and regulate as its property, for its Purpose.
3. one or more ***"Accountabilities"***, which are ongoing activities the Role will manage and enact in service of other Roles or to support its Purpose.

A Role may also hold ***"Policies"***, which are grants or constraints of authority, or special rules that apply within that Role.


## Membership

In **Fractale**, you can be part of an organization in different ways that characterized different type of membership. Your membership affects your rights and what resources you can access.  

The membership of an user can be one of the following: 

- **Guest**: When an user is invited to an organization, and do not play any specific role, they will be set up as a **Guest**. **Guest** have limited write rights.
- **Member**: If you play at least one role in an organization, you will be automatically granted as **Member**. The rights of a Member are determined by the role they play.
- **Owner**: When you create a new organization, you are automatically set up as an **Owner** of this organization. **Owners** have the maximal level authority .

## Authority

In addition to membership, a user can have one or several **roles** in a organization. Each role is defined with a level of authority that affect the rights and the resources accessible by the role leader.  

The authority of a role can be one of the following: 

#### Peer

A Peer role has the following rights within its circle:

* creation of tensions and comments.
* edit its own tensions.
* close its own tensions.
* propose draft for mandates edition.

#### Coordinator

A Coordinator role has the same rights of a Peer plus the following rights within its circle (the circle where the role is defined):

* invite members
* change tension type.
* edit tension labels.
* edit tension assignees.
* move tensions.
* creation of roles and sub-circles.
* edit circles and roles properties.
* publish mandate modifications.


#### Bot

*Work in progress*.

## Scope of authority

The authority given by a role (and so the rights that a given user has with this authority) exists in a scope delimited by circles, as follows:

- If a circle has no Coordinator role, then all Coordinators in parent circles have authority on that circle (ie can edit it).
- if a circle has one or more Coordo roles, only they (+ the Owner role) can edit that circle.
