**Organisation** (fractal): a group of humans sharing a common purpose (the root or anchor circle) organised in autonomous roles and sub-circles.  

**Role**: a function that can be linked to a member with a given mandate.

**Circle**: a set of roles and sub-circles (team, group etc.), with a given mandate.  

**Mandate**: a document that defines the function of a role or a circle by making explicit:

* its purpose: why it exists.
* its responsibilities (optional): what are the expectations of this role/circle.
* its policies (optional): the rules of access to its resources.
* its domains (optional): what properties/resources it controls.

**Tension**: A communication thread in Fractale. A tension can be used for example to track and keep record of tasks, issues, questions, propositions and so on. It has a destination which can be either a **role** or **circle**. Each newly created tension will notify users according to its destination.

A tension belong to a type according to its topic. There are five different types:

* **Operational**: A general category of tension for everyday activities. it could be a task, an issue or whatever that needs to be share in an organisation.
* **Governance**: For topics related to governance, organisational structure, mandates, etc.
* **Help**: For help requests, questions or clarifications.
* **Alert**: For alert requests, internal communication.
* **Announcement**: For announcement, external communication.

Each tension type has a notification policy and an access policy which limit respectively who will be notified at tension creation and who can do it.
See [the tension section](https://doc.fractale.co/tension) to learn more.

* modification of roles and sub-circles
* creation of tensions and comments
* modification of tensions (title, labels, assigned)

Normal roles have the following rights within their circles : 

* creation of tensions and comments 
* close your own tensions

In the agile mode, all roles have the following rights within their circles:

* creation of roles and sub-circles
* modification of roles and sub-circles
* creation of tensions and comments
* modification of tensions (title, labels, assigned)
