**Organisation** (fractal): group of humans sharing a common purpose (the root circle) organised in autonomous roles and sub-circles.  

**Role**: a function that can be linked to a member user.  

**Circle**: a set of roles and sub-circles (team, group etc).  

**Mandate**: a document that defines the function of a role or a circle by making explicit:
* its purpose: why it exists.
* its responsibilities (optional): what are the expectations of this role/circle.
* its domains (optional): what properties/ressources it controls.
* its policies (optional): the rules of access to its resources.

**Tension**: distance between where you are and where you want to be. A tension can be used for example to share and manage tasks, issues or ideas. A tension, like an email, has an emitter and a receiver (a role or a circle).
There is three main categories of tension:
* Internal (or governance): concerning the structure of the organisation its mandates etc.
* external (or operational): concerns actions carried out by the organisation
* Mutual aid (or Help): for help requests, questions or clarifications.

The organisation mode allows you to define the scope of rights associated with roles in the organisation. There are two modes:

###### coordinated mode

In the coordinated mode, the coordinator roles have the following rights within their circles:
* creation of roles and sub-circles
* modification of roles and sub-circles
* creation of tensions and comments
* modification of tensions (title, labels, assigned)
* move tensions

Normal roles have the following rights within their circles : 
* creation of tensions and comments 
* close your own tensions

###### agile mode

In the agile mode, all roles have the following rights within their circles:
* creation of roles and sub-circles
* modification of roles and sub-circles
* creation of tensions and comments
* modification of tensions (title, labels, assigned)
* move tensions

Note: the rights of a role associated with a circle are inherited in sub-circles that do not have roles.
